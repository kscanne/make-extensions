This is the "make-extensions" shell script that can be used to
create spell checking extensions (== plugins == addons) for 
LibreOffice, OpenOffice.org, Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird, etc.

Just drop a .dic, .aff, and README file in this directory, with the
following naming conventions:

xx_YY.dic, xx_YY.aff, README_xx_YY.txt

where 'xx' is the ISO 639 (2 or 3 letter) code for your language,
and 'YY' is the ISO 3166 country code.


Then do:

$ bash make-extensions xx_YY LANGUAGE-NAME-ENGLISH COUNTRY-ENGLISH VERSION

and it will produce and .xpi file for Mozilla products, an .oxt file for 
LibreOffice/OpenOffice.org 3.0+, and a .zip file for OpenOffice.org 2.x.
